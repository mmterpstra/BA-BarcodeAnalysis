BA-BarcodeAnalysis
==================

The scripts used for the analysis of the 33nt barcode data.

the [summary.md](https://github.com/mmterpstra/BA-BarcodeAnalysis/blob/master/summary.md) file contains the description of our workflow with results.


If you got here looking for demultiplexing ngs reads look for:

[bbduk from the bbmap package](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/)

[cutadapt](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt)

[fastqc](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)

[ea-utils](https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/)

If you want to apply an extended barcode(14nt for example consisting of a samplespecific part and a semi-random part goto my project [DigitalBarcodeReadgroups](https://github.com/mmterpstra/DigitalBarcodeReadgroups)
